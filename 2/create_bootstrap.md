* What is bootstrap? why do we need it?
* How we can see our curent address and become a bootstrap
* By default how libp2p already gives an ipfs address and how we can fix a address for the bootstrap for easier purpose

Try it yourself
* Create a copy of index.js ad bootstrap.js 
* Add the fix address '/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/63785/ipfs/QmWjz6xb8v9K4KnYEwP5Yk75k5mMBCehzWFLCvvQpYxF3d'
