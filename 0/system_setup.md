## Getting your system ready
> The complete tutorial could be practiced online on the browser with no setup, as the tutorial provides an interactive code editor but it is higly recommended to run the code directly from the system. 


### To try everthing directly on the system:

1. It is highly recommended to use any text editor, eg. [Sublimtext](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Visualstudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), etc.  
2. You must have access to terminal in your system. For windows users node.js terminal would work. 
1. As the tutorial uses node.js implementation of libp2p, install node.js. 
    - If you are a `MacOS` user you can use 
```bash
brew install node
```
    - If you are a `Ubuntu` user  you can use
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
    - for other operating systems please check the [official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### To use the online editor
You can directly skip to [Chapter 1](1/introduction.md)
